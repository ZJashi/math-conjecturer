\title{Level 2.5 large deviations and uncertainty relations \\ for non-Markov self-interacting dynamics}

\begin{abstract}
    We address the general problem of formulating the dynamical large deviations of non-Markovian systems in a closed form.

    Specifically, we consider a broad class of ``self-interacting'' jump processes whose dynamics depends on the past through a functional of a state-dependent empirical observable.

    Exploiting a natural separation of timescales, we obtain the exact (so-called ``level 2.5'') large deviation joint statistics of the empirical measure over configurations and of the empirical flux of transitions.

    As an application of this general framework, we derive explicit general bounds on the fluctuations of trajectory observables, generalising to the non-Markovian case both thermodynamic and kinetic uncertainty relations.

    We illustrate our theory with simple examples, and discuss potential applications of these results.

\paragraph*{\bf \em Introduction.} Communicating information related to past experiences is, arguably, one of the most peculiar features of intelligent beings. Millions of years of evolution have led small organisms, such as \textit{E.\ Coli}, \textit{P.\ Aeruginosa} and \textit{Pharaoh's ants}, to develop \textit{external spatial memories}: as these organisms navigate space, they create a memory in the surrounding environment by dropping chemicals~\cite{budrene1995dynamics,brenner1998physical,sumpter2003from,jackson2006longevity,zhao2013psl-trails,gelimson2016multicellular} or by inducing structural changes~\cite{reid2012slime}. This memory then serves other micro-organisms of the same \textit{autochemotactic} species to inform future behaviour. Such natural behaviours can also inform strategies~\cite{howse2007self-motile} used to build active self-propelling and interacting artificial agents~\cite{thutupalli2011swarming,hokmabad2022chemotactic,nakayama2023tunable}.

The typical behaviour of autochemotactic organisms can be explained using non-Markov stochastic systems, such as field-based continuum models~\cite{keller1970initiation,tsori2004self-trapping,gelimson2015collective,grafke2017spatiotemporal}, also in combination with stochastic dynamics~\cite{grima2005strong-coupling,sengupta2009dynamics,pohl2014dynamic,kranz2016effective}, and reinforced random processes~\cite{coppersmith1986random,toth2001self-interacting,othmer2006aggregation,pemantle2007a-survey,erschler2011stuck,kious2016stuck,barbier-chebbah2022self-interacting,bremont2024exact}. Self-interacting processes (SIPs)---including discrete-time chains~\cite{moral2007self-interacting,schreiber2001urn-models,coghi2025self-interacting}, continuous-time jump processes~\cite{budhiraja2025jump} and diffusions~\cite{benaim2002self-interacting,kurtzmann2010the-ode-method}---describe dynamics mediated by a functional of the ``empirical occupation measure'', a stochastic field that models changes generated by autochemotactic agents in the environment. Such self-interaction generates long-time memory and strong correlations with the past, leading to non-trivial dynamics, including ergodicity breaking~\cite{benaim2002self-interacting,benaim2005self-interacting,coghi2024current}, and modified (potentially accelerated) first-passage dynamics~\cite{aleksian2024self-interacting,coghi2025accelerated}.

Despite the importance of SIPs, their rare events have attracted systematic attention only recently~\cite{franchini2017large,budhiraja2022empirical,coghi2025self-interacting,budhiraja2025large,coghi2025accelerated,budhiraja2025jump,franchini2017large}. While the dynamical large deviations (LDs) \cite{lecomte2007thermodynamic,garrahan2007dynamical,maes2008canonical,touchette2009the-large,bertini2012large,chetrite2015nonequilibrium,garrahan2018aspects,barato2018a-unifying,jack2020ergodicity}
and their corollaries---such as bounds on fluctuations \cite{barato2015thermodynamic,gingrich2016dissipation,garrahan2017simple,terlizzi2018kinetic,horowitz2020thermodynamic}---are now well established for Markovian systems, for non-Markovian dynamics general results are mostly restricted to semi-Markov processes~\cite{maes2009dynamical,garrahan2010thermodynamics,shreshtha2019thermodynamic,carollo2019unraveling,ertel2022operationally,jia2022large,macieszczak2024ultimate,liu2024semi-markov,maier2025a-pedestrians} (see however \cite{falasco2020unifying,di-terlizzi2020a-thermodynamic,koyuk2020thermodynamic}).

Here we address this gap by studying a broad class of non-Markovian processes, specifically self-interacting jump processes (SIJPs), where interaction with the past is mediated by a functional of a general empirical observable. We analytically characterise dynamical fluctuations of SIJPs by deriving their so-called {\em level 2.5 of large deviations}, that is, the joint statistics of the long-time empirical occupation of configurations and empirical flux of transitions between them. From this fundamental result, and in analogy to what occurs in the Markovian case \cite{gingrich2016dissipation,garrahan2017simple,macieszczak2024ultimate}, one can derive general fluctuation bounds for dynamical observables, which allows us to extend both thermodynamic \cite{barato2015thermodynamic,gingrich2016dissipation} and kinetic \cite{garrahan2017simple,terlizzi2018kinetic} uncertainty relations (TURs and KURs) to this wide class of non-Markov processes.

Below we present our general results for the level 2.5 LDs and fluctuation bounds of SIJPs. The key technical advance is the observation at long times of a separation between the relevant timescales for the evolution of empirical measures, which determine the instantaneous transition rates of a SIJP, and those necessary for the microscopic jump dynamics to become fully mixing. Formal proofs appear in our accompanying long paper \cite{coghi2026proof}. We illustrate our theory with two simple examples, and discuss broader implications of our results.

\paragraph*{\bf \em Self-interacting jump processes.} We define a SIJP as the continuous-time chain $\left( X_t \right)_{0 \leq t \leq T}$ of discrete configurations, $x \in \S$ with $|\S| = d$, with $\E = \left\lbrace (x,y) \in \S \times \S: x \neq y \right\rbrace$ denoting the set of all possible jumps between them (for notation and conventions see the \hyperref[appendix]{Appendix}). At time $t$, the SIJP jumps from the current state $x$ to $y \neq x$ according to a rate $Q_{xy}(A_t) \in \mathbb{R}_+$, that depends on a general state-dependent \textit{empirical observable} of the process~\cite{touchette2009the-large,chetrite2015nonequilibrium}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:EmpObs}
    A_t = t^{-1} \int_0^t f_{X_{t'}} \, d{t'}  \,
\end{equation}
with $f: \S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ a bounded function. In order for the matrix $Q(A_t)$ to be a stochastic generator, we define its diagonal components to be the negative escape rates
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:DiagRateSIJP}
    Q_{xx}(A_t) = - \sum_{\substack{y \in \S,  y \neq x}} Q_{xy}(A_t) \, .
\end{equation}
The dependence of the generator at time $t$ on the trajectory up to that point through \er{eq:EmpObs} makes the process non-Markovian.

Two central objects of interest are the {\em empirical measure} \cite{touchette2009the-large,bertini2012large}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:EmpOccSIJP}
    L_x(t) \coloneqq
    t^{-1} \int_0^t \mathbf{1}_x(X_{t'})
    d{t'}
    \, ,
\end{equation}
viz.\ the fraction of time that the current realisation of the process has spent in each configuration in $\S$, and the \textit{empirical flux} \cite{touchette2009the-large,bertini2012large}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:EmpFluxSIJP}
     \Phi_{xy}(t) \coloneqq t^{-1} \sum_{t', \Delta X_{t'} \neq 0} \mathbf{1}_{x}(X_{t_{-}'})
         \mathbf{1}_{y}(X_{t'})
\end{equation}

viz.\ the number of jumps per unit time for every $(x,y) \in \E$.

We assume that $Q(A_t)$ is positively recurrent, and therefore irreducible over $\S$, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}_+$ and $A_t: \mathbb{R}_+ \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ (generalisation to vector valued $A_t$ is straightforward). We further assume the existence of a stationary state, which, unlike in Markov processes for the same assumptions, need not be unique. This implies that the empirical measure and flux converge in the long-time limit to their typical values.

For a Markov process with fixed generator $Q$, the stationary state $\pi$ obeys $\pi Q = 0$, and the empiricals converge to $\pi$ and $\pi \circ Q$ \cite{touchette2009the-large,bertini2012large}. In the SIJP case one needs the long-time limit of the observable,
\begin{equation}
    A_t \rightarrow
    \overline{a} = \sum_{x \in \mathcal{S}} f_x \pi_x \eqqcolon f \pi \, ,
\end{equation}
and the stationary state is a solution of the (in general non-linear) equation
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:StatSIJP}
    \pi Q(\overline{a}) = \pi Q(f \pi) = 0 \, .
\end{equation}
For a SIJP the empiricals converge to
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:TypBehav}
    L(t) \rightarrow \pi
    \, , \;\;
    \Phi(t) \rightarrow \varphi
    \, ,
\end{equation}
where we define $\varphi$ below.

\paragraph*{\bf \em Large deviations at level 2.5 for SIJPs.}
We now focus on the joint probability of the empirical  measure \eqref{eq:EmpOccSIJP} and empirical flux \eqref{eq:EmpFluxSIJP}, $P_T(\ell,\phi) \coloneqq P(L(T) = \ell, \Phi(T) = \phi)$, at some long time $T$. We will show below that these dynamical quantities obey a large deviation principle
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:Level25Joint}
    P_T(\ell,\phi) \asymp e^{-T I_{\text{2.5}}(\ell,\phi)} \, ,
\end{equation}
where $I_{\text{2.5}}(\ell,\phi)$ is the level 2.5 LD {\em rate function} for SIJPs. From this general rate function for the fluctuations of $L_T$ and $\Phi_T$, the LDs of any time-additive observable [like that of \er{eq:EmpObs}, but also those dependent on jumps] follow by contraction.

The main ingredients for obtaining \er{eq:Level25Joint} are as follows
(see the accompanying Ref.\ \ssp\cite{coghi2026proof} for full details of derivations). The first is a formulation of the path probability of a SIJP. It has the same product structure of transition rates and waiting time factors as in a Markov process, with two distinctions: the transition rates change in time through their dependence on $A_t$, and the waiting times factors are no longer the exponential of a fixed escape rate times time, but of the integral of the time-varying escape rate. Noting these departures from Markovianity, the next step is to exponentially ``tilt'' this path measure, in analogy to what is done in the Markov case.

The third step follows after making the key observation of a separation of timescales. At a given time $t$ the SIJP has a  characteristic time for relaxation coming from its generator $Q(A_t)$, for example that set by the smallest escape rate. On the other hand, $Q(A_t)$ itself changes over time due its dependence on the empirical observable. However, $A_t$ accumulates $O(1)$ changes over in $O(t)$ times, cf.\ \er{eq:EmpObs}. This means that in the long-time limit the dynamics of the ``instantaneous'' SIJP has enough time to relax before its rates change appreciably due to the change in $A_t$.

As a final step, for convenience, we make the change $t \rightarrow e^t$ inside time integrals [so that in this rescaled time the empirical observable makes $O(1)$ changes in $O(1)$ time], and measure backwards from the final time $T$ by making the flip $t \rightarrow T - t$. This finally leads to
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:RateFunct25}
    I_{\text{2.5}}(\ell, \phi)
    =
    \inf_{(\rho, H) \text{~s.t.~} (\ell,\phi)} \, \II[\rho,H] \, ,
\end{equation}
with
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:FunctionalFinal25}
    & \II[\rho,H] \coloneqq
    \\
    &
    \sum_{(x,y) \in \E}
    \int_{0}^\infty e^{-t}
    \rho_x(t) Q_{x y} (M_t) \,
    \Gamma \left( \frac{H_{xy}(t)}{Q_{x y}(M_t)} \right)
    \, dt \, .
    \nonumber
\end{align}
Here $\Gamma(x) \coloneqq x \ln x - x + 1$ is the Cram\'{e}r (or relative-entropy) rate function for Poisson statistics. In \era{eq:RateFunct25}{eq:FunctionalFinal25} there are three auxiliary quantities: $H(t)$ is the generator of a time-dependent but Markovian auxiliary dynamics, $\rho(t)$ is its ``accompanying'' distribution (instantaneous stationary state)
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:AccDistrReverse}
    \rho(t) H(t) = 0
    \, ,
\end{equation}
and $M_t$ the corresponding dynamical observable, \er{eq:EmpObs}, if the empirical density is $\rho(t)$
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:Ms}
    M_t =
        e^t \int_t^\infty e^{-t'}
        \sum_{x \in \S} f_x \rho_x(t') d{t'}
    \, .
\end{equation}
Furthermore, the minimisation in \er{eq:RateFunct25} is such that
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:RareDensity}
    \ell_x &= \int_0^\infty e^{-t'} \rho_x(t') \, d{t'}
    \, , \\
    \label{eq:RareFlux}
    \phi_{xy} &= \int_0^\infty e^{-t'} \rho_x(t') H_{xy}(t') \, d{t'}
    \, .
\end{align}
\Er{eq:RateFunct25} with definition \eqref{eq:FunctionalFinal25} and constraints \ers{eq:AccDistrReverse}{eq:RareFlux} provide the explicit form of the level 2.5 LDs for SIJPs. This is the central result of this paper.

The functional $\II[\rho,H]$ is associated to a trajectory of the SIJP of time extent $T \gg 1$.
It is local in $\rho_t$ and $H_t$ and therefore extensive in $T$ (a property that becomes evident in the original time frame). The level 2.5 rate function $I_{\text{2.5}}(\ell, \phi)$
is obtained from this functional by averaging over the ensemble of all SIJP's trajectories. In the LD asymptotics, this translates into the infimum over $(\rho_t,H_t)$, constrained on having the target long-time empirical measure and flux, giving rise to constraints \eqref{eq:RareDensity} and \eqref{eq:RareFlux}.

\Ers{eq:RateFunct25}{eq:FunctionalFinal25} can be interpreted as a dynamical reweighting of the Poissonian relative-entropy density $\Gamma(x)$, thus generalising the level 2.5 LDs for Markov jump processes~\cite{maes2008canonical,bertini2012large,barato2015a-formal}. Unlike the classical Markov case, the contraction over $(\rho,H)$ generically induces non-convexity of the functional, opening the way to richer dynamical behaviour in the generation of fluctuations of SIJPs. However, none of the examples discussed below exhibit this property, and further work is needed to identify suitable cases. Additionally, the factor $e^{-t}$ acts as an infinite-horizon temporal discount: contributions at large $t$ (corresponding to short times in the original time frame) are exponentially suppressed, reflecting that early fluctuations of the empirical measure carry a smaller cost than long-time deviations.

The minimiser $(\rho_{\rm opt}(t), H_{\rm opt}(t))$ of \er{eq:RateFunct25}, which is not necessarily unique due to non-convexity, represents the optimal way to produce the fluctuation $(\ell, \phi)$. Note that this corresponds to a time-dependent yet Markovian dynamics generated by $H_{\rm opt}(t)$. For the special case of the SIJP generator $Q(A_t)$ being independent of $A_t$, which makes the SIJP into a standard Markov jump process, it is easy to see that \ers{eq:RateFunct25}{eq:RareDensity} reduce to the standard Markovian level 2.5 LD result \cite{maes2008canonical,bertini2012large,barato2018a-unifying}: in this case $(\rho_{\rm opt}, H_{\rm opt})$ become time-independent, the integral in \er{eq:FunctionalFinal25} is trivial, and $(\ell, \phi)$ coincide with $(\rho_{\rm opt}, \rho_{\rm opt} \circ H_{\rm opt})$.
A notable special case is SIJPs with rate matrices that are affine functions of the empirical density $L(t)$, whose large deviations were rigorously analysed in Ref.\ \ssp\cite{budhiraja2025jump}. \Ers{eq:RateFunct25}{eq:RareDensity} extend these rigorous results beyond affine SIJPs to a broader class. While our results are exact in the statistical-physics sense, they lack the full mathematical rigour of Ref.\ \ssp\cite{budhiraja2025jump}, a gap we aim to close in future work.

\paragraph*{\bf \em Kinetic uncertainty relation for SIJPs.}

The general level 2.5 LD result above is useful in practice in two ways. The first is that the long-time LDs of any time-extensive trajectory observable can be obtained by {\em contraction} from the LDs of the empirical measure and flux. The second is that \er{eq:RateFunct25} is variational, so that even if the exact minimisation is difficult, an approximate one can provide a bound to the true rate function. This latter is the approach used to prove TURs and KURs using LD methods \cite{gingrich2016dissipation,garrahan2017simple}.

Consider a generic flux observable, that is, a quantity that depends additively on the jumps in a trajectory. For a given trajectory it can be written as a contraction with the empirical flux
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:GenFluxSIJP}
    B_T = \sum_{(x,y) \in \E} \beta_{xy} \Phi_{xy}(T) \, .
\end{equation}
Assuming stationarity, at long times $B_T$ will become typical, $B_T \rightarrow \overline{b} \coloneqq \sum_{\substack{(x,y) \in \E}} \beta_{xy} \varphi_{xy}$ in probability, cf.\ \er{eq:StatSIJP}. The probability of fluctuations will have an LD form, $P(B_T = b) \asymp e^{-T I(b)}$, where the rate function $I(b)$ can be obtained from the level 2.5 one \eqref{eq:RateFunct25} with the extra constraint
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:bconst}
    b = \sum_{\substack{(x,y) \in \E}} \beta_{xy} \phi_{xy}
    \, .
\end{equation}

While exact minimisation of \er{eq:RateFunct25} under \er{eq:bconst} is in general not doable, we can get an approximation with a simple Ansatz where the empirical density coincides with the stationary state, $\ell^* = \pi$, but the flux is a rescaling of the stationary one, $\phi^* = (b / \overline{b}) \, \varphi$, cf.\ Refs.\ \ssp\cite{gingrich2016dissipation,garrahan2017simple}. In order to satisfy the \ers{eq:Ms}{eq:RareFlux} we have to set
\begin{equation}
   \rho^*(t) = \orho(t)
   \, , \;\;
   H^*(t) = (b / \overline{b}) \, Q(\oM_t)
   \, ,
\end{equation}
that is, the time-dependent generator of the auxiliary process is simply the typical generator of the SIJP rescaled by an overall factor, and where the typical $\orho$ is defined via \era{eq:AccDistrReverse}{eq:Ms} for the typical $H_t = Q(\oM_t)$.

Inserting into \er{eq:RateFunct25} we obtain the general bound
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:IbBoundSIJP}
    I(b) \leq
    k_{\text{SIJP}} \,
    \Gamma( b / \bar{b})
    \, ,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:DynActSIJP}
    k_{\text{SIJP}} \coloneqq
    \sum_{\substack{(x,y) \in \E}}
    \int_0^\infty e^{-t} \,
    \orho_{x}(t)
    \,
    Q_{xy}(\oM_t) \, dt
    \, ,
\end{equation}
is the average \textit{SIJP dynamical activity}. It generalises the standard dynamical activity \cite{lecomte2007thermodynamic,garrahan2007dynamical,maes2020frenesy:} of Markov jump processes to the non-Markovian case of SIJPs which corresponds to the number of configuration changes per unit time.

Expanding \er{eq:IbBoundSIJP} to second order around $\overline{b}$ we obtain a bound on the asymptotic variance of $B_T$,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:KURSIJP}
    \frac{{\rm var}(b)}{\overline{b}^2}
    \geq
    \frac{1}{k_{\text{SIJP}}}
    \, ,
\end{equation}
which we refer to as SIJP-KUR, generalising the KUR of time-homogeneous Markov processes~\cite{garrahan2017simple,terlizzi2018kinetic}. As for Markov processes, the average dynamical activity of a SIJP provides an elementary bound to the quadratic precision of observables.

\paragraph*{\bf \em Thermodynamic uncertainty relation for SIJPs.}

While the SIJP-KUR is valid for all flux-like observables \eqref{eq:GenFluxSIJP}, it can be refined, as in the Markovian case,  for currents, for which $\beta_{xy} = -\beta_{yx}$. This is done by writing the time-dependent flux in terms of its symmetric and antisymmetric parts, $\rho(t) \circ H(t) \eqqcolon (v(t) + u(t))/2$, and solving exactly in \era{eq:RateFunct25}{eq:FunctionalFinal25} for the symmetric part $u(t)$, cf.\ Refs.\ssp\cite{maes2008canonical,bertini2012large,barato2015a-formal}. Doing this, the functional $\II$ in \er{eq:FunctionalFinal25} is replaced by
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:CurrRateSimplTURSIJP1}
    \tII[\rho, v]

    \, .
\end{equation}

The LD rate function $I(j)$ of any current observable
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:GenCurrSIJP}
    J_T =
    \sum_{x < y}
        \beta_{xy} (\Phi_{xy}(T) - \Phi_{yx}(T))
    \, ,
\end{equation}
can be obtained from the level 2.5 \eqref{eq:RateFunct25} by contraction using \er{eq:CurrRateSimplTURSIJP1} with constraints (\ref{eq:AccDistrReverse}-\ref{eq:RareDensity}), and (\ref{eq:RareFlux2},\ref{eq:GenCurrSIJP}). Even if the exact calculation is not practical, one can obtain a general upper bound to $I(j)$. The steps to do this are analogous to those taken to derive the TUR in the Markovian case \cite{gingrich2016dissipation}.

The first step is to choose the same Ansatz as in the SIJP-KUR for the empirical density, $\ell^* = \pi$, which in turn implies that $\rho^*(t) = \orho(t)$. The second step is to bound from above the function $\Psi ( v_{xy}, v_{xy}^\orho, u_{xy}^\orho )$ with a form quadratic in $v_{xy}$, as is done in the proof of the TUR \cite{gingrich2016dissipation}. The third step is to perform the minimisation over $v(t)$ in the resulting bound of the functional $\tII[\orho, v]$. An application of the Cauchy--Schwarz relation eventually yields
(see Ref.\ \ssp \cite{coghi2026proof} for detailed derivations)
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:TURBoundRate}
    I(j)
    \leq
    \frac{(j - \oj)^2}
    {4 \int_0^\infty e^{-t}
        (j_t^{\orho} / \sigma_t)
    \, dt}
    \, .
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:TypTrajCurr}
    j_t^{\orho}
    &\coloneqq
    \sum_{x < y}
        \beta_{xy} j_{xy}^{\orho}(t)
    \, ,
    \\
    \label{eq:TotEntrProdSIJP}
    \sigma_t
    &\coloneqq
    \sum_{x < y}
        \ln \left(
                \frac{\orho_x(t) Q_{xy}(\bar{M}_t)}
                {\orho_y(t) Q_{yx}(\bar{M}_t)}
            \right)
        j_{xy}^{\orho}(t)
    \, .
\end{align}
Here $j_t^{\orho}$ is the typical instantaneous current, such that $j_t^{\orho} \rightarrow \oj$ in the long-time limit, and
$\sigma_t$ is the instantaneous \textit{entropy production rate of the SIJP}, since $\orho_t$ is stationary for $Q(\bar{M}_t)$ and $\bar{M}_t$ can be thought of as an ``internal'' adiabatic protocol.

Expanding \er{eq:TURBoundRate} to second order around $\oj$ gives a bound to the quadratic fluctuations of the current
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:TURSIJPs}
    \frac{{\rm var}(j)}{\oj^2}
    \geq
    2
    \int_0^\infty
        e^{-t} \frac{(j_t^{\orho} / \oj)^2}{\sigma_t}
        \, dt
    \, ,
\end{equation}
which we refer to as SIJP-TUR, generalising the TUR of continuous-tiome Markov processes \cite{barato2015thermodynamic,gingrich2016dissipation}. As in the case of the TUR, \er{eq:TURSIJPs} shows that increasing precision for the current incurs a cost in terms of instantaneous entropy production. Since it is not possible to disentangle in the integral
the instantaneous entropy cost from the the instantaneous current, we can interpret the instantaneous entropy production as an additional discount on the SIJP necessary to reach a certain level of precision.

Note that both the SIJP-KUR \eqref{eq:KURSIJP} and SIJP-TUR \eqref{eq:TURSIJPs} reduce to the standard Markovian KUR and TUR in the limit when the SIJP becomes a Markov process. Note  also that the SIJP-TUR \eqref{eq:TURSIJPs} would hold in the case of {\em external} driving, as long as the protocol evolves as slowly as $A_t$ in a SIJP.

\paragraph*{\bf \em Simple examples.} We now illustrate the general results above with two simple examples.

The first example is a two-state SIJP, $\S = \{0,1\}$, with transition rates $Q_{01} = 1 + e^{\alpha A_t}$, with $A_t = L_1(t)$, and $Q_{10} = 1$, with $\alpha > 0$. This describes a spin whose flip-up rate grows exponentially with its past occupation. There is a unique equilibrium state $\pi$, which for example for $\alpha = 2$ is  $\pi_0 = 0.12...$ (with $\pi_1 = 1 - \pi_0$), thus favouring occupation of the up state.

Figure~\ref{fig:all}(a) illustrates the level 2.5 result by showing the rate function at ``Level 2'' $I_2(\ell)$, obtained minimising \er{eq:RateFunct25} over the flux $\phi$. This exact result coincides with Monte Carlo simulations. We also show an upper bound obtained by assuming solutions of the variational problem to be time-independent \cite{donsker1975asymptotic}: for larger deviations $I_2(\ell)$ departs the Markov approximation
because larger fluctuations entail sharper variations in $\rho(t)$ and $M_t$, see Fig.~\ref{fig:all}(b).

Figure~\ref{fig:all}(c) shows the exact rate function $I(b)$ for the flow observable $B_T = \Phi_{01}(T)$ obtained by contraction from \er{eq:RateFunct25}, and which coincides with the Monte Carlo simulations (whose range is limited to the values around the typical). We also show the SIJP-KUR upper bound from the r.h.s.\ of \er{eq:IbBoundSIJP}.

We illustrate the SIJP-TUR in a system with a non-zero stationary current, that of a particle on a three-state ring, $\S = \{0,1,2\}$, with a self-induced drag and cyclic transitions: $Q_{01}=Q_{12}=Q_{20}=e^{-\alpha L_1(t)}$ and $Q_{10}=Q_{21}=Q_{02}=1-e^{-\alpha L_1(t)}$. Dynamics slows down when state $1$ is visited frequently, and the more the particle lingers in one region, the harder it becomes to sustain a current. In Fig.~\ref{fig:all}(d) we compare the statistics for the particle current,
$J_T = \sum_{x<y} (\Phi_{xy}(T) - \Phi_{yx}(T))$ from Monte Carlo simulations, with the SIJP-TUR bound for the rate function given in \er{eq:TURBoundRate}.

\paragraph*{\bf \em Conclusions.} Self-interacting processes offer a rich setting for uncovering universal principles of non-Markovian dynamics. Here we have derived the exact dynamical large deviations at level 2.5, that is the full joint statistics of the empirical measure and fluxes, of self-interacting continuous-time processes.

For concreteness, we focused on SIJPs with generators dependent on empirical observables of configurations. Our results, however, are easily generalisable to self-interacting systems where the dynamics dependends also on the accumulated fluxes: if $A_t$ in \er{eq:EmpObs} also adds $t^{-1} g_{xy}$ for every jump between $x$ and $y$ in a trajectory, the corresponding level 2.5 LDs are
also given by \ers{eq:RateFunct25}{eq:RareFlux}, with the change
$\sum_x f_x \rho_x \to
\sum_x f_x \rho_x + \sum_{xy} g_{xy} \rho_x H_{xy}$
in the integrand on the r.h.s.\ of \er{eq:Ms}. See Ref.\ssp\cite{coghi2026proof} for a detailed derivation.

As is the case with Markovian systems, an important application of the level 2.5 LDs framework is in the derivation of bounds on the fluctuations (to all orders) of dynamical observables, which for quadratic fluctuations are the so-called thermodynamic and kinetic uncertainty relations.
Here, we obtained the corresponding versions for SIJPs of the
thermodynamic \cite{barato2015thermodynamic,gingrich2016dissipation}
and kinetic
\cite{garrahan2017simple,terlizzi2018kinetic}
uncertainty relations, the SIPJ-TUR and SIPJ-KUR.
More refined and tighter bounds, such as a generalisation of the ``ultimate'' KUR \cite{macieszczak2024ultimate} (also known as the ``clock'' uncertainty relation \cite{prech2024optimal}) can be obtained by generalising the approach of \cite{macieszczak2024ultimate} to SIJPs, see \cite{coghi2026proof}. The present framework could, in principle, also be adapted to derive bounds for first-passage times \cite{garrahan2017simple,gingrich2017fundamental} beyond the Markovian regime. An extension to open quantum dynamics with memory would also be interesting.

\paragraph*{\bf \em Appendix: notation and conventions.}
\label{appendix}

We use upper case for random variables (or functions) and lower case for their realisations, while reserving $P$ for probability: $P(X=x)$ means the probability of the random variable $X$ taking value $x$, for which we often just write $P(x)$.

We use a compact notation for multidimensional objects: given vector $\pi \coloneqq (\pi_x)_{x=1:d}$ and matrix $Q \coloneqq (Q_{xy})_{x,y=1:d}$, $\pi Q$ denotes their internal product, $(\pi Q)_y = \sum_{x=1}^d \pi_x Q_{xy}$, and use $\circ$ for Hadamard product, with $\pi \circ Q$ having elements $\pi_x Q_{xy}$.

For scalar quantities we write the time dependence with a subscript, e.g.\ $A_t$, for compactness.

$\mathbf{1}_x(\cdot)$ is the indicator function, which gives one if the argument coincides with $x$ or zero otherwise.

We use overbar to mark typical values, e.g., $\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} A_t = \bar{a}$.

The symbol $\asymp$ indicates equality up to sub-exponential factors in a large parameter, so that $P(\cdot) \asymp e^{-T I(\cdot)}$ is equivalent to $I(\cdot) = \lim_{T \to \infty} T^{-1} \ln P(\cdot)$.

We define the asymptotic variance of an (intensive) trajectory observable such as $B_T$ as ${\rm var}(b) \coloneqq \lim_{T \to \infty} T \, {\rm var}(B_T)$.

We use the ``maths'' convention of probabilities being row vectors, stochastic generators having rows adding up to zero, and time-propagation being left to right, e.g.\ $\partial_t \mu = \mu Q$.
