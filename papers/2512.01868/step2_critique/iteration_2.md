**STATUS:** PASS

**CRITIQUE:**
* The summary excels in explicitly comparing new results to prior work (Markdahl et al., Taylor) and identifying precise gaps addressed (quantitative rates, d=2 extension, long-context scaling).
* It clearly defines the mathematical setting (\(\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\), Wasserstein flows) and key models (SA/USA dynamics, equiangular reduction), ensuring self-containedness.
* Limitations and boundaries are thoroughly addressed: counterexamples (d=2 failure modes), technical obstructions (topological constraints, metastability), and model dependencies (normalization schemes).

**GUIDANCE:**
While the summary is strong, ensure all theorem references in the "Impact" section (e.g., Theorem 4 for long-context scaling) are formally restated in the "Main Results" section for completeness. Explicitly define \(\gamma\) when first introducing the phase transition result.
