**STATUS:** PASS

**CRITIQUE:**
* The summary excels in explicitly comparing prior results (Markdahl/Criscitiello for \(d \geq 3\), Kuramoto for \(d=2\)) with the new contributions (quantitative rates, metastability, Transformer-specific phase transitions).  
* It clearly defines the SA/USA dynamics, energy functional, and geometric setting, ensuring self-containedness.  
* Limitations (e.g., \(d=2\) gap, mean-field small-\(\beta\) requirement) and counterexamples (multi-cluster mean-field for large \(\beta\)) are rigorously addressed.  

**GUIDANCE:**  
While the summary is strong, future revisions could further emphasize:  
1. The **exponential vs. constant contraction rates** (\(\lambda_\text{USA} \sim e^\beta\) vs. \(\lambda_\text{SA} \sim 1\)) in Theorem 2 as a key distinction between normalized/unnormalized dynamics.  
2. The **critical scaling \(\gamma = 1/(1-\rho)\)** in the long-context phase transition (Theorem 4) when stating results.
