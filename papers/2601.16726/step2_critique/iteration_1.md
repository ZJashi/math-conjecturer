**STATUS:** PASS

**CRITIQUE:**
* The summary **explicitly compares** the new GPRF model with the standard Poisson random field (PRF), highlighting the key innovation (multiple points in infinitesimal regions) and cites prior fractional PRF work [Leonenko2015, Kataria2024].  
* It **details technical obstructions** (e.g., independence of subordinators crucial for FGPRF proofs, challenges in extending to $d \geq 3$), ensuring readers understand the limitations.  
* All **mathematical symbols** (e.g., $\Theta(k,n)$, $\lambda_j$, Caputo derivatives) are defined, and the logical flow from problem setup to results is coherent.  

**GUIDANCE:**  
While the summary passes, future iterations could briefly mention if the fractional order constraints ($\alpha + \beta \leq 1$) are conjectured to be necessary or an artifact of the method.
